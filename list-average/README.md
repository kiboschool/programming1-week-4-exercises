# List Average: Instructions  

Use a loop to find the average of a list of numbers.

To find the average (or 'arithmetic mean'), you add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.

## Testing

First, try commenting out the initial list, and testing your loop with lists
with averages that you know. The list `[1]` should have an average of 1, the list `[1,2,3]` should have an average of `2`, etc.

Then, uncomment the list and run the tests to check your solution.

## Hints

* The `len()` function can tell you how long a list is, which is how many elements it has. You'll need to know the number of elements to find the average.
