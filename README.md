# List Average: Instructions  

Use a loop to find the average of a list of numbers.

To find the average (or 'arithmetic mean'), you add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.

Run the tests to check your solution. They won't tell you the right answer, but printing the right answer should pass the tests.

## Hints

* The `len()` function can tell you how long a list is, which is how many elements it has. You'll need to know the number of elements to find the average.
